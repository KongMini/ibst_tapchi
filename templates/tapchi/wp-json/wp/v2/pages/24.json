Making a good impression in the mediation business counts, too. Even if you have years of experience on the bench and name recognition to go along with it, having a mediation website design that reinforces your expertise will give you an advantage in what can sometimes be a crowded mediation market. We&#8217;ve successfully worked with several retired judges to transition them from the bench to the private mediation business. We&#8217;ve also worked with seasoned trial attorneys to design and set up their mediation websites.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>What content should a mediation website include?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Mediation website design projects tend to be smaller in scope than<a data-type=\"page\" data-id=\"22\" href=\"https:\/\/www.dangilroy.com\/mid-sized-law-firm-website-design\/\"> a mid-sized law firm website<\/a> but can rival in size and scope to <a data-type=\"page\" data-id=\"20\" href=\"https:\/\/www.dangilroy.com\/small-law-firm-website-design\/\">small law firm websites<\/a>. It just depends on the particular mediator and their wants and needs. Still, we&#8217;ve had other mediators satisfied with the simple <a data-type=\"page\" data-id=\"26\" href=\"https:\/\/www.dangilroy.com\/law-firm-landing-page-design\/\">landing page design<\/a> we created for them. With that said, here are some suggestions for the types of sections and pages a mediation website design project should consider, including:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Home Page.<\/strong>\u00a0When it comes to mediation websites, it&#8217;s all about emphasizing experience and qualifications. To that end, design the home page of your mediation website to promote your credentials as a mediator. You&#8217;ll want to strike a serious tone. Through the smart use of images, design, color, and text, you influence how your mediation business is perceived. Often we&#8217;ll use a captivating image on the home page and couple that with a headline that sums up the value of your practice. You&#8217;ll want your contact information prominently displayed in several places at both the top and bottom of the home page. Bear in mind that a good percentage of your website visitors will be coming to your website for contact details and mediation scheduling information. The home page of your mediation website can also include a summary of biographical information; it can list the particular practice areas you mediate &#8211; this is especially helpful if you are a mediator specializing in a specific niche.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<\/li><li><strong>Mediation Scheduling Information. <\/strong>  A must-have on just about every mediation website is having mediation scheduling information prominently displayed.  There are different ways to approach this.  Some mediators elect to simply display a phone number and email address, together with instructions on who to contact for scheduling inquiries.  This has worked for several of our mediation clients.  Another effective way to is to include a contact form with specific fields for names of parties, preferred dates, half-day or full-day options, names of counsel, and even the ability to upload a copy of the complaint.  However you decide to approach it, designing your mediation website to provide clear and concise scheduling guidance is a must-have item which can greatly help your mediation business run smoothly.  <\/li><li><strong>Testimonials \/ <strong>Attorney Endorse<\/strong>ments.<\/strong>  In our experience, mediators can sometimes be a bit reluctant to include testimonials on their website or solicit attorney endorsements from parties they&#8217;ve mediated.  They should not be.  Client reviews and testimonials are part of the business landscape on the web and they can go a long way toward building your reputation as a go-to mediator. If you&#8217;re not utilizing testimonials or attorney endorsements on your website, chances are a competitor of yours is.  <\/li><li><strong>Contact Page.<\/strong>\u00a0For mediators, it is important to include a contact page on your website. Link the contact page from your main navigation menu and make sure it appears on every page.\u00a0 \u00a0Your contact page should also include instructions for scheduling inquiries.\u00a0 If your mediation business is associated with <a href=\"https:\/\/www.adrservices.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">ADR Services, Inc.<\/a>, perhaps include the email and phone number of your case manager, especially if they are the one to contact for scheduling inquiries.\u00a0 If you have a contact form, the contact page is the perfect place for that.\u00a0 In short, your website\u2019s contact page, with its associated email links, forms, and scheduling information, is one of the most important tools for building strong relationships with your prospective clients.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h2>We specialize in designing websites for mediators<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Dan Gilroy Design has been designing mediation websites for nearly twenty years. With so much experience working with mediators and their websites, we&#8217;ve developed a good sense of what mediation websites need to look like and what information they should include. A mediation website should be aesthetically pleasing, easy to use, and informative for the best visual appeal. Our goal is to create websites that help you increase website traffic, generate leads, and grow your mediation business.&nbsp;&nbsp; Each mediation website project we build includes the following features:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Custom Website Design.\u00a0<\/strong>\u00a0All of our mediation websites are custom designed to fit the needs of each specific mediator. We do not use website templates or out-of-the-box WordPress themes to create our mediation website designs. Instead, we prefer to build our websites from the ground up to tailor the look, feel, and functionality of the website to your specific needs. We make sure they\u2019re visually appealing, informative, user friendly, and easy to update.<\/li><li><strong>Speed &amp; Security.\u00a0<\/strong>\u00a0We&#8217;re known for making beautiful law firm websites, but we&#8217;re also invested in creating fast and secure websites. Our websites are backed by a robust set of automated and manual security systems. Your website is constantly monitored to ensure that no vulnerabilities exist or that any of the plugins we&#8217;re using have security issues.\u00a0 In addition, we make a point of testing and measuring the load time of our clients&#8217; websites. We want to be sure that the website is not adversely impacting the load speed of high traffic, high value pages.<\/li><li><strong>Search Engine Optimization (SEO).\u00a0<\/strong> Strong on-page SEO is one of the pillars of a great mediation website design. \u00a0On-page SEO means optimizing your content, title tags, page titles, alt tags, headings, URL, and so on for search engines.\u00a0 In short, we build our mediation websites to be search engine friendly. With nearly twenty years of experience, we know how to code and design modern, search engine friendly websites.<\/li><li><strong>Mobile Readiness.<\/strong>\u00a0 At Dan Gilroy Design, we build all our websites using a responsive, fluid grid to provide website visitors an optimal user experience regardless of the computing device they are viewing the website on.\u00a0 Each year, more and more people\u00a0are accessing websites via mobile devices, so you need to make sure that the website you have for your mediation business is\u00a0 optimized for those devices.\u00a0 Moreover, websites that are mobile-friendly tend to rank better than websites that are not optimized for mobile\u00a0viewing.<\/li><li><strong>WordPress CMS.<\/strong>\u00a0 We use WordPress as our contentment management system (CMS). It\u2019s an open source CMS that has been around since 2003 and it\u2019s still growing in popularity. WordPress is perfect for us because it allows us to deliver a customized backend experience for our mediation website clients where they can easily edit content, like scheduling information, on any computer whenever they want and wherever they are.<\/li><li><strong>Scalable.<\/strong>\u00a0 If you&#8217;d like, you can easily add sections and pages as your mediation practice grows.\u00a0 With each mediation website we design, it\u2019s easy to add new attorney or staff bio pages, or new sections highlighting your mediation experience, presentations you&#8217;ve made, or recent speaking engagements.\u00a0\u00a0<\/li><li><strong>24\/7\/365 Support.<\/strong>\u00a0 Our mediation websites run on a state-of-the-art hosting platform designed specifically for WordPress and backed by an army of WordPress engineers 24\/7\/365.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>If you&#8217;re a mediator or are thinking of starting a mediation practice, creating a website that promotes your business and underscores the value of your&#8230;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"parent":0,"menu_order":49,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","template":"single-firm-size-page.php","meta":[],"acf":[],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v19.0 - https:\/\/yoast.com\/wordpress\/plugins\/seo\/ -->\n<title>Mediation Website Design | Web Design For Mediators<\/title>\n<meta name=\"description\" content=\"For nearly 20 years, Dan Gilroy Design has helped mediators across the U.S. with creating beautiful mediation website designs.

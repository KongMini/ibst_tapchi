At the same time, it&#8217;s essential to recognize that meeting the needs and expectations of your website visitors is equally important. Your target audience is at the forefront of all design decisions we make. Each design decision is calculated to ensure that we create an engaging website that satisfies your desire for a great\u00a0<\/span><a class=\"editor-rtfLink\" href=\"https:\/\/www.dangilroy.com\/lawyer-website-design\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">lawyer website design<\/span><\/a><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">\u00a0while meeting your targeted audience&#8217;s need for information and direct assistance. For instance, how we approach a law firm web design for an insurance defense firm will be different from how we design a website for a criminal defense attorney. In short, different law firms with differing audiences demand tailored approaches.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>2. Adherence to Fundamental Search Engine Optimization (\u201cSEO\u201d) Principles<\/h3>\n<p>At Dan Gilroy Design, we understand that <a href=\"https:\/\/www.dangilroy.com\/five-tips-to-better-law-firm-web-design\/\">top-rated law firm web design<\/a> can&#8217;t occur without a foundation of strong on-page SEO and technical SEO. Implementing core on-page and technical SEO principles comes standard with our website design projects. On-page SEO refers to steps we take to improve each web page&#8217;s content and source code so that they have a better chance of ranking higher and earning more relevant traffic in search engines. To this end, we implement a checklist of items targeted toward increasing search visibility. These items include URL optimization, title tag optimization, writing engaging meta descriptions, adding external links where appropriate, adding internal links, optimizing images for size and speed, and optimizing images for size and speed. Each site we build comes equipped with an SEO plugin to make managing on-page SEO items a breeze. On the technical SEO side of the ledger, we&#8217;ll submit <a href=\"https:\/\/yoast.com\/what-is-an-xml-sitemap-and-why-should-you-have-one\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">XML sitemaps<\/a> to search engines so they are aware of your website and understand its organization. Each website we create also comes with a free SSL certificate so that your site runs through the secure HTTPS protocol. Of course, we make sure your website is mobile-ready so that it looks great on a desktop computer and looks great on a phone or tablet device.<\/p>\n<h3>3. Focus on Website Speed &amp; Performance<\/h3>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Another part of the technical SEO equation relates to website speed and user experience. A prominent example of this is page-load time. Nobody likes a slow website, and neither do search engines. At Dan Gilroy Design, we pay a lot of attention to page-load time and core web vitals. Core web vitals are metrics that Google developed for developers to measure their website&#8217;s speed, performance, and user experience. Core web vitals is also a Google ranking factor, so it&#8217;s best to be scoring high in that regard. As part of our focus on speed and user experience, we implement caching on each website we build. In short, caching is a vital\u00a0<\/span><a class=\"editor-rtfLink\" href=\"https:\/\/www.dangilroy.com\/lawyer-seo\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">lawyer SEO<\/span><\/a><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">\u00a0tool that, when used effectively, can help boost your website&#8217;s ability to rank well organically by delivering pages faster. Each website we build goes through multiple instances of speed and performance testing throughout the project so that we can ensure that our design decisions aren&#8217;t slowing down your website at all.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>4. Security-Focused WordPress Hosting<\/h3>\n<p>Finally, website hosting often gets overlooked during the website design process because our law firm clients don&#8217;t know much about it (and why should they?), or they may think that website hosting is all the same, regardless of the provider. With nearly twenty years of experience, we can categorically say that is not true. From our perspective, website hosting is a critical piece of the overall user experience and also plays a vital role in SEO. Reliable web hosting will help you avoid a slew of trouble down the road regarding website hacks or malware infections that cheap, discount website hosting often invites. The WordPress hosting platform we use protects our clients from these threats. WordPress version updates, both major and minor, are taken care of automatically. No more worrying whether your website is running the latest, most secure version of WordPress. It&#8217;s all taken care of for you. Security alerts for vulnerable WordPress plugins are also standard with our websites so that we can keep your website free from security vulnerabilities. In addition, a backup of your website is stored every night on a separate server going back 30 days.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The Four Pillars of Great Law Firm Website Design 1.\u00a0 Stylish Law Firm Website Design Tailored To Your Firm&#8217;s Specific Audience Modern, visually appealing law&#8230;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"parent":0,"menu_order":1,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","template":"page-portfolio.php","meta":[],"acf":[],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v19.0 - https:\/\/yoast.com\/wordpress\/plugins\/seo\/ -->\n<title>Law Firm Website Design by Dan Gilroy | Custom Websites for Lawyers<\/title>\n<meta name=\"description\" content=\"Your website is often your next client&#039;s first impression of you.

That old adage is very true, especially for small law firm website design. For small law firms and solo attorneys, your website is often where people first judge you on your skill as a lawyer. And as unfair as it may be, consumers sometimes equate poor-quality websites with poor legal services. That&#8217;s a situation you want to avoid.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So what exactly is a small law firm? We think of it as any law firm with ten or fewer attorneys. Of course, solo attorneys are also in this group. In fact, we build some of the best solo attorney websites in the U.S. Working with small law firms and solo attorneys is our bread and butter and something we enjoy very much.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>What sections and pages should small law firms include on their website?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We get this question a lot. Luckily, we have the answers with almost twenty years of experience building websites for lawyers. When walking clients through the&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.dangilroy.com\/lawyer-website-design\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">lawyer website design<\/a>&nbsp;process, we often refer to the following as the &#8220;core&#8221; set of sections and pages that each solo attorney or small law firm website should have:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Home Page.<\/strong>  Think of the home page as your website&#8217;s hub. Everything a client may want should be accessible from this page within a click or two. The type of information you include on your home page and how much will depend on your project&#8217;s specifics.  <\/li><li><strong>Practice Area Pages.<\/strong>  It would be best if you had a section on the website that discusses the legal services you provide. We typically recommend creating individual pages for each practice area rather than having one web page to discuss every matter your law firm handles. We do this for two reasons. First, it will be easier for your website visitors to find the legal services they need if you provide them in easy-to-find subcategories. Secondly, and sometimes, more importantly, creating individual pages for specific practice areas is a good&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.dangilroy.com\/lawyer-seo\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">lawyer SEO<\/a>&nbsp;practice. It increases the likelihood that people can find your law firm via a web search for that particular topic.<\/li><li><strong>Attorney Bios Pages.<\/strong>  Your website should have a section for attorney bios. No matter how many attorneys are in your law firm, each attorney should have a dedicated bio page. Again, it will make it easier for visitors and search engines to find individual attorneys. Also, be sure your attorney bio pages include a photo of the attorney. Having an attorney photo increases the trust factor with potential clients. This is especially true for solo attorney websites.<\/li><li><strong>Contact Page.<\/strong>  Even if your law firm&#8217;s contact information is on every page of the website, we advise our clients always to have a separate Contact page and include it in the main navigation. Website visitors will still want to click on a Contact page for information, maps, email addresses, etc. The Contact page allows you to connect with your target audience. Please take advantage of it.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The sections and pages above should be the minimum you consider for your small law firm website design project. Other sections and pages that you should consider for your website include:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>A Blog.  <\/li><li>Testimonials\/Google Reviews.  <\/li><li>Representative Clients<\/li><li>Results.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h2>Small law firm web design specialists<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>At Dan Gilroy Design, we understand how consumers think and interact with websites.

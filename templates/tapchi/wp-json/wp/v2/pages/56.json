In each case, every client wants a website design that will reflect their law firm in a positive light.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>First time website design projects<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Whether you&#8217;re a seasoned trial lawyer starting a new law firm or a new lawyer hanging your shingle for the first time, you&#8217;ll need a&nbsp;<a data-type=\"page\" data-id=\"7\" href=\"https:\/\/www.dangilroy.com\/\">law firm website design<\/a>.

If you need some&nbsp;<a data-type=\"page\" data-id=\"12\" href=\"https:\/\/www.dangilroy.com\/law-firm-website-design\/\">law firm website design inspiration<\/a>&nbsp;we can help you out there. We&#8217;ll elicit your input on design considerations such as layout, color scheme, photography, and use of images. We&#8217;ll guide you on best practices in design, content creation, <a data-type=\"page\" data-id=\"201\" href=\"https:\/\/www.dangilroy.com\/lawyer-seo\/\">search engine optimization<\/a> (SEO), and website management. In short, we&#8217;ll be there for you at each step.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p><strong>SUMMARY:<\/strong>  All websites require careful planning and the first time you go through this process can be an educational experience. We will guide you step-by-step through the process, offer sound and sage advice, and make the website creation experience a positive one.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<h2>Website redesign projects<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Many of our clients already have a website but are unsatisfied with it. Perhaps it&#8217;s an old, outdated design; maybe it&#8217;s not mobile-friendly, or maybe you&#8217;ve reached the end of a contract with a law firm marketing provider and want to go with a new <a href=\"\/\">law firm website design company<\/a>. In these cases, you may already know what you want your website to look like, what content it should include, who your target market is, and so on. You understand, though, that the look and feel of the website itself are all wrong. That&#8217;s when a website redesign is in order.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are several benefits to redesigning your website. Design trends change, and so do the expectations from your audience as to how your website should look and perform. A modern website design translates into greater trust from website visitors and search engines. It offers you the opportunity to convert to mobile compatibility if you haven&#8217;t already, refresh your logo and brand, and focus on creating new, engaging content.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p><strong>SUMMARY:<\/strong>  There are several benefits to redesigning your website and the process of building the new website is often less onerous than building a website for the first time.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<h2>The importance of having a mobile compatible website<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>From a user experience alone, your website should be mobile-friendly. Mobile devices generate approximately <a href=\"https:\/\/www.statista.com\/statistics\/277125\/share-of-website-traffic-coming-from-mobile-devices\/#:~:text=Mobile%20accounts%20for%20approximately%20half,consistently%20surpassing%20it%20in%202020.\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">half of all web traffic<\/a> today. It&#8217;s the same story year after year, and we expect the trend to continue through 2022 and beyond. By then, mobile devices will probably have surpassed desktops and laptops as the main source of web traffic. That continues the exponential trend upwards in mobile device use as a percentage of all Internet traffic. Moreover, more searches are now conducted on mobile devices than they are from desktop computers. If that&#8217;s not enough, optimizing your website for mobile compatibility represents a competitive advantage, as Google provides mobile friendly websites with preferential treatment in search engine results. In short, if you don&#8217;t have a mobile compatible website by now, you risk losing website traffic and credibility. At Dan Gilroy Design, we build our <a href=\"\/\">lawyer websites<\/a> on a responsive, fluid grid to provide website visitors with an optimal&nbsp;mobile experience.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p><strong>SUMMARY:<\/strong>  To remain relevant and competitive, your website must be mobile-friendly. If it isn&#8217;t, call us today to chat. All our websites are mobile-friendly.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<h2>Building a web presence<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We design our websites with <a data-type=\"page\" data-id=\"201\" href=\"https:\/\/www.dangilroy.com\/lawyer-seo\/\">lawyer SEO<\/a> in mind. We take care to do those things that, as designers and developers, we have immediate control over to positively impact your website&#8217;s organic search engine rankings. But search engine optimization (SEO) is a vast field encompassing many disciplines and relates to both on-page and off-page influences. Accordingly, at Dan Gilroy Design, we consider building a&nbsp;holistic web presence&nbsp;rather than mere organic SEO &#8211; as SEO is limiting. Other factors, such as local search, pay-per-click (PPC), and social media, also impact your overall web presence, and thus, your ability to be found. Talk to us today about how we can help you build your website presence.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p><strong>SUMMARY:<\/strong>  Building a web presence is more than just SEO. Local search, pay-per-click, and social media can all play a significant role in establishing a strong website presence on the Internet.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\">*****<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>For nearly twenty years, attorneys and law firms have trusted Dan Gilroy Design to create visually appealing, fast, and secure websites for desktop and mobile devices.

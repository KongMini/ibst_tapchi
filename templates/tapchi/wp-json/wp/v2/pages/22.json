Your law firm&#8217;s website is often where potential clients first form an opinion of your law firm. The quality of your law firm&#8217;s website can even decide whether or not a client chooses to hire you. Website design for mid-sized law firms is no different. You can&#8217;t afford to give off a negative impression of your law firm to potential clients or referring attorneys by having a subpar website. You want to make sure your <a href=\"\/\">law firm web design<\/a> is professional, attractive, and consistent with your brand.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, what exactly is your law firm brand? In short, it&#8217;s your law firm&#8217;s image. It is the unique combination of the legal services you provide and your law firm&#8217;s personality or culture. It&#8217;s the first thing people think when they hear your name. It&#8217;s what your website visitors see when they land on your website. For mid-sized large law firms &#8211; any firm with 20 to 50 lawyers &#8211; it&#8217;s vital that your website nail your law firm&#8217;s image and make that first great impression.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>What type of content should law firms put on their website?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Mid-sized law firms and larger-sized law firms typically have more resources to dedicate to their websites than small ones. Accordingly, large and mid-sized law firm web design projects tend to have more sections and pages than&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.dangilroy.com\/small-law-firm-website-design\/\">small law firm website design<\/a>&nbsp;projects. In our nearly twenty years of experience, we&#8217;ve seen all sorts of content on law firms of this size, but here&#8217;s a sampling of what you should consider, including:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Home Page.<\/strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;When it comes to creating your law firm&#8217;s brand or image, the home page of your law firm&#8217;s website is a critical piece of digital real estate. Here, you can manage and shape your website&#8217;s brand through design, color, and text as to what kind of firm you are and how you want to be perceived. In our experience, the amount of content on the home page of mid-sized law firm websites tends to be more compact, and the page tends not to scroll as much on&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.dangilroy.com\/small-law-firm-website-design\/\">small law office websites<\/a>. Still, the home page, like any website, must serve a critical role as the gateway to the rest of your website through intelligent design and easy navigation.&nbsp;<\/li><li><strong>Practice Area Pages.<\/strong>&nbsp;It&#8217;s not enough to list your practice areas on a single page. For mid-sized law firms and large law firms, your potential clients are typically larger institutions, other law firms, or insurance companies. In short, your target audience is expecting more. Not only should you have well-written descriptions of each of your practice areas, but each practice area page should also list the attorneys who practice within that particular practice group. Moreover, if there is a practice group chair or principal contact, consider listing this person on the page and their contact information. This will make it easier for potentials clients, referring attorneys, or the media to make direct inquiries. Finally, consider erring on the side of having too much content on each practice area page. Don&#8217;t be shy about describing what you do and how you can help. Perhaps you can include related content like case studies, specific results achieved, or even a list of representative clients or related industries on these pages.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/li><li><strong>Attorney Directory &amp; Attorney Bios Pages.<\/strong>&nbsp;A mid-sized law firm web design best practice is to include a dedicated attorney directory page. This page should, at minimum, contain each attorney&#8217;s photo, name, title, and link to their full bio page. You may also want to include other items on this page, such as a direct dial phone number, email link, and v-card link (yes, those are still a thing). Another feature we like to include in the attorney directories we design is the ability for website visitors to filter the attorney directory by practice areas or office location. Larger-sized law firms should stick to a uniform protocol for individual bio pages when developing bio page content. It&#8217;s easier for attorneys and law firm marketing departments to generate dozens of attorney bios if everyone creates them from the same agreed-upon outline. Of course, seasoned partners will have more experience and accompanying awards, articles, speaking engagements, and so on than a junior associate who just passed the bar, so their bios will be more robust at times.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/li><li><strong>Contact Page.<\/strong>&nbsp;When designing websites for law firms, we recommend that you always have a contact page that should appear at the top of your site on every page. This is so your website visitors can easily find your contact page and reach out to you. The contact page on your website is one of the best tools available to connect with your target audience. Use it to reach out and engage with them.  <\/li><li><strong>Blog.<\/strong>  Mid-sized law firms with adequate resources should seriously consider adding a blog section to their website. Having a blog is a great way to share your expertise in your particular field of law. By writing and sharing blog posts that you think existing clients and potential clients will find helpful, you build credibility with your audience and show search engines that you are an authority in your field. Some law firms have blogs called &#8220;News&#8221; or &#8220;Updates.&#8221; However you label your blog, it is a proven way to add valuable and insightful website content that will benefit your website visitors and boost your website traffic.<\/li><li><strong>Client Reviews \/ Testimonials.<\/strong>  Having client reviews and testimonials on your website is a proven way to reinforce the value of your services while increasing the likelihood that a potential client will pick up the phone and call or fill out a contact form to get in touch. If you can embed or cite client reviews from&nbsp;<em>verified<\/em>&nbsp;sources such as Google and Yelp, that is even better. Having verified reviews on your website is especially valuable and highly recommended for consumer-facing attorneys such as criminal defense attorneys, DUI defense attorneys, and personal injury attorneys. If you&#8217;re a corporate law firm or insurance defense firm, client reviews are not as critical and might be less of a priority for you.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h2>We specialize in designing websites for mid-sized law firms<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>For nearly 20 years, Dan Gilroy Design has produced beautiful website designs for mid-sized law firms and larger law firms. As one of a handful of companies that have been developing sites exclusively for attorneys for that long, we are among the&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.dangilroy.com\/\">best law firm website design companies<\/a>&nbsp;in the United States. With that much experience, we&#8217;ve developed a great understanding of what clients and potential clients want &#8211; and don&#8217;t want &#8211; in a law firm website. In short, they want a visually appealing website that&#8217;s easy to use and informative. Our mid-sized and large law firm websites are engaging and nice to look at, and they&#8217;re fast and secure. Each website project we build includes the following features:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Custom Website Design.&nbsp;<\/strong>&nbsp;Our mid-sized law firm websites are custom-made from the ground up. We make sure they&#8217;re responsive, user-friendly, and easy to update. Our law firm websites are not created from cookie-cutter, pre-made law firm website templates or repurposed law firm WordPress themes. Instead, we customize them specifically for your law firm and your needs.<\/li><li><strong>Speed &amp; Security.&nbsp;<\/strong>&nbsp;While we&#8217;re known for creating beautiful-looking websites, we&#8217;re invested in creating fast and secure websites, too. Our WordPress websites are backed by a robust set of automated and manual security systems. We constantly monitor to ensure that no vulnerabilities exist in your website or that any of the plugins you&#8217;re using have issues with them. In addition, we make a point of carefully considering our clients&#8217; websites&#8217; page-load times, particularly those of high volume, high-value pages. We test as many aspects of the website as we can to make sure it&#8217;s not affecting your site&#8217;s performance.<\/li><li><strong>Search Engine Optimization.&nbsp;<\/strong> Great law firm website design can&#8217;t occur without a foundation of strong on-page SEO and technical SEO. We implement core on-page and technical SEO principles into every project we undertake. On-page SEO refers to steps we take to improve each web page&#8217;s content and source code so that they have a better chance of ranking higher and earning more relevant traffic in search engines.<\/li><li><strong>Mobile Readiness.<\/strong>&nbsp; At Dan Gilroy Design, we build all our mid-sized law firm websites on a responsive, fluid grid to provide website visitors with an optimal experience regardless of their device. There are several reasons why having a mobile-friendly website is essential. For instance, mobile websites are easier to use and provide a better experience for the user. They&#8217;re more likely to rank higher on search engines. You&#8217;re more likely to have success with converting website visitors into clients.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/li><li><strong>WordPress CMS.<\/strong>&nbsp; We use <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/WordPress\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">WordPress<\/a> as our contentment management system (CMS) for all client websites. WordPress is an Open Source CMS that has been around since 2003 and has grown to be the most popular CMS on the Internet. We love it because it allows us to deliver a customized and intuitive client backend experience. They can easily access and update their websites from any computer whenever they want, whether editing an attorney bio or creating a blog post.<\/li><li><strong>Scalability.<\/strong>&nbsp; You can easily add sections and pages as your law practice, or law firm grows. This scalability is essential for mid-sized law firms and large law firms that produce a lot of content. With our websites, it&#8217;s easy to add new attorneys and practice areas. If you want to include a new section, that can be done easily.<\/li><li><strong>Around The Clock Support.<\/strong>&nbsp; Our websites run on a state-of-the-art hosting platform built specifically for WordPress and are backed by WordPress engineers who are available 24\/7\/365.<\/li><\/ul>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>In the legal profession, first impressions matter.
